# EasyBooking
EasyBooking is a platform designed to simplify the process of finding and reserving venues for various events, including weddings, birthday parties, conferences, and more. Planning an event can be time-consuming, but our website allows users to browse through a variety of halls and their details, making the process quick and easy.

We also provide a platform for hall owners to showcase their properties and manage reservations with ease. Our website features detailed descriptions of each hall, including photos, availability, and pricing information, ensuring that users can make informed decisions when selecting a venue.

Our team, consisting of Nemat Mimi, Nqaa Ladadweh, and Raneen Ramahi, collaborated on the backend, frontend, and database work. Hussain Mimi handled the server upload.

Whether you're planning an event or managing a venue, EasyBooking offers a simple and efficient solution. Visit our website at http://easy-booking.link/ to get started.
